Reactive Chat is a web application designed to help children who experience verbal communication challenges. This type of tool is known as Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) software, created to support and enhance communication for individuals with speech or language challenges.

The application’s user interface and experience are guided by well-established AAC design principles, ensuring familiarity and ease of use for those already accustomed to traditional AAC systems. The layout and visuals are intentionally modeled after proven, research-backed AAC designs to promote accessibility and effectiveness.

Reactive Chat is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to a wide range of screen sizes, from small mobile devices to large desktop displays. This flexibility allows users to engage with the application on whatever technology they have available, making communication more accessible anytime, anywhere.

## Frameworks, Libraries, and Tech
Reactive Chat is built with React and JavaScript to deliver a smooth, dynamic, and responsive front-end user experience. The front-end communicates with a Node.js and Express back-end that manages data, authentication, and overall application logic.

The server uses Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database, where all user-related information is securely stored. Sensitive data is protected with BCrypt, which encrypts and verifies user credentials to ensure a higher level of security and privacy.

## Access to Website
Reactive Chat is officially online and in version 1.1.1. The image functionality now uses The Noun Project to look for images!

## Code Usage
This project is open-source so others can learn from it and build upon it. I make my main projects open-source to encourage collaboration and support other developers in creating their own applications. You’re welcome to use or adapt any part of this code to help bring your ideas to life.
