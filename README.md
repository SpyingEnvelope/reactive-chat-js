# Reactive Chat is a WIP

## Reactive Chat is currently live!

Reactive chat is a web application I created in order to allow children who cannot verbalize to communicate. This type of communicative device is called an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) device.

Reactive chat currently has a bug where the search option for images no longer works. This is because the API I was using to search for images recently went offline. I am currently in the process of trying to get an access token to a different API. This bug will be fixed shortly.
