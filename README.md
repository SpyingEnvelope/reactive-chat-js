# Reactive Chat is a WIP

## Reactive Chat is currently live!

Reactive chat is a web application I created in order to allow children who cannot use verbal communication to communicate. This type of communicative device is called an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) device.

Reactive Chat is officially in alpha version 1.1.1. The image functionality now uses The Noun Project to look for images!
